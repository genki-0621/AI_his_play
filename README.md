# XOR Perceptron with Manual Kernel

This is a historical recreation of the XOR problem using a single-layer perceptron enhanced with manually engineered features (`x1 * x2`).

## ðŸ“Œ What it does

- XOR canâ€™t be solved linearly.
- Manually adding `x1 * x2` allows linear separation.
- Simulates early AI research techniques.

## ðŸ§  Run the code

```bash
python xor_manual_kernel.py
